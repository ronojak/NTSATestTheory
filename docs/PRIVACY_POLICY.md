# Privacy Policy — DriveTheory CBT

Effective Date: 2026-01-13

DriveTheory CBT is an offline-first practice app. We do not collect, transmit, or sell personal data.

- Data stored locally: exam attempts (score, total questions, timestamp) and app settings. This data remains on your device.
- No account required. No cloud services are used in this version.
- Network access: not required for core features.
- Permissions: none beyond standard app operation. Screenshot blocking is enabled during an active exam to protect content integrity.
- Children’s privacy: the app is suitable for general audiences and does not target children specifically.

Your Choices
- You can uninstall the app to remove all locally stored data. Clearing app storage from system settings also removes local data.

Contact
- For questions or requests, contact the developer via the Play Store listing email.
